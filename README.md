# Tap-Ball

Tap ball is all about placing balls/objects virtually around your physical environment by simply tapping on the screen. A ball/virtual object can appear to stay in the same place relative to the real world, even as the user tilts the device to look above or below the object, or moves the device around to see the object's sides and back. This is done by using  ARWorldTrackingConfiguration
